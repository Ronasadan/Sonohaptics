# Project Description 
Sonohaptics is a wearable vest which enhances the music experience for music lovers, hard-of-hearing people and curious individuals who have the desire to try unusual haptic-music sensations.
This work describes the design process of the vest- from the idea, trough the different iteration and up to the final prototype.Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmLW62-ZVMg&feature=youtu.be

## The process 
The project consists of several output elements : 

**Pressure waving pneumatic  We designed two waist straps made of six pneumatic pouches each. The straps and pouches were made of TPU coated Nylon fabric, heat-sealed with pieces of baking sheets.

* First step: Iterating on different pouches patterns with trash bags.

* Seconed step: Prototyping the chosen pattern from the Nylon fabric. We used the laser cutter to cut both the straps and the baking sheet patterns. The straps are 28In width X 3In height , divided into two separate sides of 13 In each ( we left one inch in the middle for wiring( .

* Tubing:  We have inserted 4 tubes for each one of the pouches and connected the fifth tube to the upper part of the vest so it will blow air on the neck and will enhance goosebumps sensation.
